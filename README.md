# ZanuiFixturesBundle

This bundle defines abstract fixture classes to load test data into a database. It complements the
[DoctrineFixturesBundle](https://github.com/doctrine/DoctrineFixturesBundle) by extending and implementing
classes from the [Doctrine2 Data Fixtures library](https://github.com/doctrine/data-fixtures) to ease the pain
of loading data fixtures programmatically into the Doctrine ORM.
Please read the [documentation](http://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles/DoctrineFixturesBundle/index.htm) for
that bundle first to get familiar with the basic concepts that we will build upon.
